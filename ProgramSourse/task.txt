To develop complex of programs for modeling ecosystem.

If alfa = 0 - two populations do not cooperate, alfa > 0 foxes meet rabbits
with probability proportional numbers of those and others.

- To explore the conduct of ecosystem at alfa = 0.01 and different values r0 and f0.
- To confirm circumstance that the conduct of the system is periodic.   

Input data:
- r0 = 300, f0 = 150;
- r0 = 15,  f0 = 22;
- r0, f0 = (2000; 20000);

Output data:
- system's period;
- tables;
- graphics;

Content of course work:
- individual task and explanatory note;
- software on CD.
